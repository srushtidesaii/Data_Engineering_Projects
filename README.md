This repository showcases my data engineering and data analysis projects, which encompassed the utilization of various on-premise database technologies such as SQL, MySQL, PostgresSQL, DBeaver, as well as cloud databases like Azure SQL and Azure Data Studio. These projects involved leveraging tools like Google BigQuery and Azure Data tools for data processing and analysis. I employed Talend and Alteryx for data preparation, profiling, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, while SQL Server was used for querying the databases. To present the data in a visually appealing and informative manner, I employed PowerBI and Tableau for data visualization and gained valuable insights to support data-driven decision-making.
